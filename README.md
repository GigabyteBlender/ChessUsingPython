# Chess Game Project

## Overview
This project is a simple chess game implemented in Python. It allows two human players to play chess against each other on a command-line interface. The game follows standard chess rules and provides various features.

## Key Features
- **Chess Board Representation**: 8x8 grid made using pygame
- **Piece Movement**: Implementation of legal moves for each chess piece
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Alternating moves between white and black players
- **Check and Checkmate Detection**: Basic implementation to identify check and checkmate situations
- **Game State Tracking**: Keeping track of captured pieces and move history
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring players enter valid moves and coordinates

## Skills Learned

1. **Python Programming Fundamentals**
   - **Data Structures**: Utilizing lists, dictionaries, and classes to represent the game state
   - **Control Flow**: Implementing game logic using loops and conditional statements
   - **Functions**: Breaking down the game into modular, reusable functions

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Class Design**: Creating classes for the game board, pieces, and players
   - **Inheritance**: Implementing a base Piece class and derived classes for specific chess pieces
   - **Encapsulation**: Organizing related data and methods within classes

3. **Algorithm Design**
   - **Move Validation**: Developing algorithms to check for legal moves for each piece type
   - **Check and Mate Detection**: Implementing logic to determine if a king is in check

4. **User Input Handling**
   - **Input Validation**: Ensuring user inputs are within the correct format and range
   - **Error Handling**: Implementing try-except blocks to handle invalid inputs gracefully

5. **Game State Management**
   - **Board Representation**: Managing the 2D representation of the chess board
   - **Turn Tracking**: Implementing a system to alternate between players
   - **Legal Move Generation**: Creating a foundation for potential AI opponent implementation in the future

6. **Software Development Best Practices**
   - **Code Organization**: Structuring the project into logical modules and functions
   - **Documentation**: Writing clear comments and docstrings to explain code functionality
   - **Version Control**: Using Git for tracking changes and managing the project

7. **Problem-Solving Skills**
   - **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing issues in the game logic and implementation

## Future Development
This project provides a solid foundation in Python programming and game development concepts. Future enhancements could include:
- **AI Opponent**: Implementing a basic AI opponent using algorithms like Minimax
- **Advanced Features**: Adding support for more complex chess rules and features
